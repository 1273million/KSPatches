You get your first glimpse of the Deinonychus as you sneak around a tent city in the middle of a swamp. It hisses softly, starting its chilldown cycle. And you keep still because maybe you think that it's only certified for up to 10 re-uses, and it's not firing up just for you. But oh no, not the Deinonychus. You stare at it and the Deinonychus just stares right back at you. And that's when the ignition comes. Not from the front, but from the side, from the two other engines you didn't even know were there. Because the Deinonychus is designed for clustering, you see, it uses coordinated gimbaled thrust and it is out in force today. And it comes at you with this - a full-flow staged combustion methalox cycle. It doesn't bother to use a kerosene gas generator like other, inferior engines, no. The point is, you are alive when the spark igniter turns the hot methane gas into a column of flame, so, try to show a little respect.

The Eagle, an evolved vacuum-optimized version of the fearsome engine with a fully regeneratively cooled bell, can propel you into the highest of heavens and not break the bank either. Clever girl.
