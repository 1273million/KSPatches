## Features

This mod features several improvements to the Isp of a lot of engines, mostly converting them to hydrolox Isp levels.

* **Hydrogen Isp** The aerospike, SSME, Rhino, Mammoth, Skipper, Skiff, Poodle, and Mainsail all get hydrogen Isps, in a range of 430-460s.
* **Methane Isp** The Terrier engine is the only one with this Isp value, one of 358s.
* **Fluorine Isp** The Wolfhound and Cheetah engines are based on better mixtures than hydrogen.
  * Wolfhound is based on lithium-fluorine-hydrogen tripropellant, with an Isp of 566s to match.
  * The Cheetah is based on fluorine-hydrogen, with some magic that makes its plume blue and not green.
  * The Poodle engine was the measuring stick. If anything was better than it, it got an Isp above 470s. Nervs are exempt.

This mod also features fuel tank and engine weight reduction.

* All fuel tanks have their dry weight reduced to 1/3 normal.
* Engines have their weight reduced by anywhere from 1/2 normal to 1/4 normal.

## External Mod Compatibility

This mod includes compatibility patches for the following mods:
* Making History Expansion: Provides Skiff, Wolfhound, Cheetah engines, and 1.875m + 5m fuel tanks.
* NF Launch Vehicles: Provides 7.5m and 5m fuel tanks.
* ReStockPlus: Patches all fuel tanks included there (except the Pug engine.)

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. My current wishlist is to add support to the ReStockPlus engines, and the remaining stock + DLC engines for the weight reduction patches.
