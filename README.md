## Features

This mod features several improvements to the Isp of a lot of engines, mostly converting them to hydrolox Isp levels.

* **Hydrogen Isp** The aerospike, SSME, Rhino, Mammoth, Skipper, Skiff, Poodle, and Mainsail all get hydrogen Isps, in a range of 430-460s.
* **Methane Isp** The Terrier engine is the only one with this Isp value, one of 358s.
* **Fluorine Isp** The Wolfhound and Cheetah engines are based on better mixtures than hydrogen.
  * The Wolfhound is based on lithium-fluorine-hydrogen tripropellant, with an Isp of 566s to match.
  	* My headcanon is that this engine has RTGs to accelerate the (incredibly toxic) exhaust by another ~230m/s.
  	* This is as far as I've learned; I am **not** learning how to edit effects and to use ModuleWaterfallFX.
  * The Cheetah is based on fluorine-hydrogen, with some magic that makes its plume blue and not faint pink.
  * The Poodle engine was the measuring stick. If anything was better than it, it got an Isp above 470s. Nervs are exempt.

This mod also features fuel tank and engine weight reduction.

* All fuel tanks have their dry weight reduced to 1/3 normal.
* Engines have their weight reduced by anywhere from 1/2 normal to 1/4 normal.

## External Mod Compatibility

This mod includes compatibility patches for the following mods:
* Making History Expansion: Provides Skiff, Wolfhound, Cheetah engines, and 1.875m + 5m fuel tanks.
* NF Launch Vehicles: Provides 7.5m and 5m fuel tanks.
* ReStockPlus: Patches all fuel tanks included there, including the Pug.
* Any mod you can think of that adds engines or tanks: because the MM patches apply to every engines and tanks from **every mod**.

## Contributing

I certainly accept pull requests. Add mods on the wishlist to the engine and tank weight adjustments.

### Mod Wishlist

Mods on the wishlist include:
* Near Future Launch Vehicles by Nertea (done with tanks, patch engines)
* CryoEngines by Nertea (patch engines)
* CryoEngines Extensions by Kavaeric (make LFO patch)
* CryoTanks by Nertea (patch tanks)
or any mod you can think of that adds engines or fuel tanks. The SpaceY suite comes to mind.
